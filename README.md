# Exercise 4: River advection (with working subplots)

For the exercise this week we will be applying the advection equation to bedrock river erosion.
The goal is to see how river profiles evolve in nature using a spatially variable advection coefficient (stream-power erosion).

For each problem you need to modify the given notebook, and then upload your files to GitHub.
The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the document in places where you are asked.

- **Exercise 4 is due by the start of class on on 26.11.**
- Don't forget to check out [the hints for this week's exercise](https://introqg.github.io/qg/lessons/L4/exercise-4.html) if you're having trouble.
- Scores on this exercise are out of 20 points.

This tutorial is based on a MATLAB exercise from [Prof. Todd Ehlers (University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany)](http://www.geo.uni-tuebingen.de/?id=2183) and [Prof. Brian Yanites (University of Indiana, USA)](http://www.geology.indiana.edu/yanites/index.html).
